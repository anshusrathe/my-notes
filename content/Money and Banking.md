# Money and Banking Part I
## Evolution of Money and Banking

### Barter Exchange and Introduction of Money
- In ancient times, barter exchanges were cumbersome due to the <span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)">double coincidence of wants</span>
- An intermediate commodity like gold or silver was chosen as money due to its limited supply and universal acceptance.

### Challenges with Gold-Based System
- Increased production required more gold coins for transactions, leading to supply-demand issues.
- Carrying physical gold for transactions was inconvenient and risky.

### Emergence of Paper Currency
- Trusted individuals like person X facilitated paper transactions backed by physical gold.
- Paper slips issued by X became the currency "Rupee," backed by gold deposits.

### Transition to Fiat Currency
- RBI started issuing currency notes based on asset reserves, not necessarily gold.
- Increased production led to more currency issuance by RBI to facilitate transactions.

### Role of Commercial Banks
- Commercial banks acted as intermediaries between RBI and the public for smoother transactions.
- Money supply increased based on expected real GDP growth and inflation targets set by RBI.

### Money Supply and Inflation Dynamics
- ==Money supply adjustments affect inflation depending on changes in output/GDP.==
  - Increased money supply with decreased or constant output may lead to price hikes.
  - Decreased money supply with increased or constant output may result in price decreases.

### Seigniorage and Revenue Generation
- Seigniorage refers to profits from money creation, benefiting central banks through various channels like interest income and inflation tax.
  - Interest income from reserves and bank balances with central banks.
  - Inflation tax contributes to revenue as currency value declines due to inflation.

## Exchange Rate

### Exchange Rate Mechanisms
- Before 1993, India used fixed and adjustable exchange rates, adjusting rupee value for competitiveness.
- Post-1993, with higher inflation, rupee depreciation occurred naturally due to market forces.

### Types of Floating Exchange Rates
1. **Free Float:**
   - Central bank doesn't intervene; exchange rates determined solely by market forces.
   - Examples: US, Japan, some European countries.

2. **Managed Float:**
   - Central bank intervenes if domestic currency becomes highly volatile.
   - RBI manages rupee's stability by buying/selling foreign currencies through select banks.

## Securities
- Securities are tradable financial instruments promising future returns.
- Two main categories: equity (ownership) and debt (borrowed money).

### Equity Securities
- Represent ownership in a company.
- Holders receive dividends and capital gains.
- Equity holders have voting rights and control over the company.

### Debt Securities
- Represent borrowed money with fixed terms like interest rate and maturity date.
- Holders receive regular interest payments and principal repayment.

### Company Investment and Securities Issuance
- Investors can invest in companies through equity or debt securities.

#### Equity Investment
- Investors become owners and receive profits/dividends based on company performance.

#### Debt Investment
- Investors lend money at a fixed interest rate and receive regular interest payments and principal repayment.

#### Company's Balance Sheet Example
- check from notes if want.

## Government Securities (G-Secs) Overview

- G-Secs are issued by the Central or State Governments and are considered risk-free.
- They are issued through auctions on the E-Kuber platform (<font color="#ff0000">part of the CBS platform</font>), managed by RBI.
- ==Members of E-Kuber include commercial banks, scheduled UCBs, Primary Dealers, insurance companies, and provident funds.==

### Types of Government Securities

1. **Treasury Bills (T-Bills):**
   - Short-term debt instruments ==(<1 year)== issued at a discount and redeemed at face value.
   - Zero coupon securities, traded in the money market.

2. **Cash Management Bills (CMBs):**
   - Short-term instruments introduced in 2010 for maturities ==less than 91 days==.
   - Traded in the money market, similar to T-Bills.

3. **Dated Securities:**
   - Long-term securities (5 to 40 years) with various categories:
     - Fixed rate bonds: Interest rate fixed till maturity.
     - Floating rate bonds: Interest linked to Treasury bill yields.
     - Inflation indexed bonds: Principal and interest protected against inflation.
     - Special Securities: Issued to entities like oil and fertilizer companies as compensation.
     - ==Bank Recapitalisation Bonds: Issued to Public Sector Banks.==
     - ==Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs): Linked to gold prices, budgeted in lieu of market borrowing.==

1. **State Development Loans (SDLs):**
   - Long-term bonds issued by States with maturities over one year.
   - ==Qualify for Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements.==

### Government Securities Market

- ==Regulated by RBI, facilitating primary and secondary market transactions.==
- ==Includes Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM) <font color="#ff0000 ">(Secondary Market for G-Sec)</font>and stock exchanges.==
- Retail Direct Scheme by RBI allows retail investors to directly invest in these securities.
- Inclusion in the Global Bond Index can attract foreign investment, potentially reducing domestic borrowing pressures.
- <font color="#ff0000">Individuals participate in the non competitive auctioning process of G-Securities in Primary Market</font>

### Retail Direct Scheme (RDG) by RBI

- Allows retail individual investors to open RDG accounts and invest in Govt. securities directly.
- Retail investors can purchase Central Govt. Securities, State Govt. Securities, and ==Sovereign Gold Bonds.==
- Enhances investment opportunities, especially for middle-class individuals and small businesses.
- Provides guaranteed settlement, ensuring safety for small investors.

### Indian Govt. Securities in Global Bond Index

- Inclusion in the Global Bond Index allows easier access to foreign capital for the Govt. of India.
- Issuing debt in foreign currencies or listing in international indices can lower interest rates for Govt. bonds.
- ==Foreign investment in Indian bonds increases liquidity and reduces domestic borrowing pressures.==
- Removal of approval requirements for foreign investors and caps on investments in Govt. securities.
- RBI's Financial Markets Regulation department handles listing in international platforms like "Euroclear."

## Corporate Bond Market in India Overview

### Importance and Challenges

- ==A deep and liquid corporate bond market can reduce vulnerability to volatile foreign capital flows.==
- It can supplement the banking system in providing long-term capital for corporate investments.
- Challenges include limited transparency, expensive public offering processes, and lack of investor protection laws.

### Factors Contributing to Slow Growth

1. Limited transparency and governance standards among corporate entities.
2. Expensive and time-consuming public offering processes.
3. Lack of bankruptcy laws for investor protection (addressed by IBC 2016).
4. High costs in building necessary market infrastructure.

### Government Initiatives for Development

1. Increased FPI ceiling in corporate bonds from 9% to 15% to attract more foreign investment.
2. Framing an investor charter for transparency and grievance redressal.
3. ==Introduction of a 'backstop facility' to purchase investment-grade bond papers during stressed and normal times, supporting market development.==

## Money Supply

### Definition
Money in an economy includes currency notes, coins, and deposits in banks.

### Issuance and Circulation
- Currency notes and coins are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
- One-rupee notes and coins are ==minted/printed== by the Government of India.
- RBI is the sole authority for ==issuing== currency and coins in India.
- Currency notes and coins are put into circulation through RBI.

### Liability and Asset
- Coins and one-rupee notes are liabilities of the Government of India.
- ==RBI buys one-rupee notes and coins from the government, treating them as assets.== (Unitary currency is printed by the govt. meaning it can not default and is treated as asset by the RBI.)
- Banknotes (except one rupee) issued by RBI are backed by assets like gold, Govt. securities, and foreign currency assets.

### Obligation and Guarantee
- "I promise to pay the bearer..." on currency notes denotes RBI's liability to pay the value.
- ==This liability is guaranteed by the Government of India as per the RBI Act, 1934.==
### Value and Legal Tender
- ==Currency notes and coins derive value from RBI's promise and are called fiat money.==
- They are legal tenders and cannot be refused for payment or debt discharge.

### Money Supply Measures
1. **M1**: Currency with the Public + Demand deposits of public with banks. (Liquidity ↑↑↑↑)
2. **M2**: M1 + Savings Deposits with Post Office Savings Bank.(Liquidity ↑↑↑)
3. **M3**: M1 + Time deposits of public with banks. (Liquidity ↑↑) =={Aggregate Money Supply}==
4. **M4**: M3 + Total deposits with Post Office Savings Bank. (Liquidity ↑)

### Components
- Deposits of the public with banks are part of money supply (excluding inter-bank deposits).
- Cash reserves of commercial banks are not considered part of money supply.

### Liquidity
- M1 is the most liquid, M4 is the least liquid.
- M1 and M2 are narrow money, M3 and M4 are broad money.
- M3 is commonly used and known as "aggregate monetary resources".

## Money Creation Mechanism

### Ratios and Assumptions
- **Currency Deposit Ratio (cdr)**: 1 (Assumption)
- **Reserve Deposit Ratio (rdr)**: 0.2 (20%) (Assumption, includes CRR and SLR)

### Process of Money Creation
1. RBI purchases assets worth Rs. H, issuing currency notes of Rs. H to person P1.
2. P1 keeps half as cash and half as a deposit in the bank (assuming cdr = 1).
3. Bank keeps 20% (rdr) as reserves and lends the rest (0.8H) to P2.
4. Money supply increases from H to H + 0.4H = 1.4H due to fractional reserve banking.
5. Process continues as P2, P3, and so on deposit and lend, creating new money each time.

### Money Creation Table
| Currency with Public | Vault Cash | Deposits of Public | Money Supply |
|----------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------|
| P1: H/2              | H/2        | H/2                | H            |
| P2: 0.8 (H/2)        | 0.2 (H/2)  | H/2                | H + 0.4H     |
| P3: 0.8/2 (0.8 (H/2))| 0.2/2 (0.8 (H/2))| H/2           | H + 0.8H     |
| ...                  | ...        | ...                | ...          |
| Sum                  | 1/2 (5H/3)| 0.2/2 (5H/3)       | 5H/3         |

### Money Multiplier Calculation
- **Money Supply (M3)**: 5H/3
- **Monetary Base (M0)**: H
- **Money Multiplier**: M3/M0 = (5H/3) / H = 5/3

### Conclusion
By starting with an initial monetary base of H, the RBI increases the money supply to 5H/3 through fractional reserve banking, resulting in a money multiplier of 5/3.

## Monetary Policy in India

### Definition and Objectives
Monetary Policy is the process through which the monetary authority (RBI) controls the creation and supply of money in the economy. The objectives of monetary policy in India include:
- Maintaining price stability
- Ensuring adequate credit flow to productive sectors for supporting economic growth
- Achieving financial stability

### Evolution of Monetary Policy Framework
1. **Objective**: Primarily maintain price stability with growth in mind.
2. **Framework Operator**: RBI operates the monetary policy framework.
3. **Inflation Target**: Set at 4% with a band of +/- 2%, decided by the Government of India in consultation with RBI.
4. **Failure to Meet Target**: Inflation above 6% or below 2% for three consecutive quarters is considered a failure.
5. ==**Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)**: Constituted in September 2016, determines the Policy (Repo) Rate.==
   - ==Comprises 6 members, 3 from RBI and 3 appointed by the Government of India.==
   - ==Decisions based on twin objectives of inflation and growth, with price stability given primacy.==

### MPC Framework Details
1. **Meeting Frequency**: At least 4 meetings in a year, currently held bi-monthly with the option for "Off-cycle" meetings.
2. **Decision Authority**: ==MPC decides the repo rate only==, not reverse repo, CRR, SLR, etc.
3. **Voting Structure**: Each member has one vote, with the Governor having a second or casting vote in case of equality.
4. **Binding Decision**: MPC decisions are binding on RBI.

### Considerations and Limitations
- **Focus Areas**: Price stability and growth, with no consideration for currency market fluctuations.
- **RBI Instruments**: Other instruments deployed by RBI for dealing with currency market fluctuations as per requirements.

- Banks have specific targets for lending to priority sectors as mandated by the RBI.
- Shortfalls in lending contribute to funds like the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF).

## 1.14 New Models for Priority Sector Lending by RBI
### 1.14.1 On-Lending Model
- Under this model, registered Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) including Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) can lend to various priority sectors, and these loans will be considered as Priority Sector Lending.
- Banks can classify only the fresh loans sanctioned by NBFCs, out of bank borrowing, as priority sector lending.
- Bank credit to NBFCs for ’On-Lending’ is allowed up to a limit of five percent of an individual bank’s total priority sector lending on an ongoing basis.

### 1.14.2 Higher Weights for Incremental Priority Sector Credit in ’Identified Districts’
- RBI has introduced a system to rank districts based on per capita credit flow to the priority sector.
- Districts with comparatively lower credit flow (per capita PSL less than Rs.6000) banks will receive a higher weight (125%) for their incremental priority sector credit in these districts.
- Districts with higher credit flow (per capita PSL greater than Rs.25,000) banks will have a lower weight (90%) for their incremental priority sector credit in these districts.
- This incentivizes lending to districts with lower credit flow and disincentivizes lending to districts with higher credit flow.

### 1.14.3 Co-Lending Model by Banks and NBFCs
- RBI issued guidelines for Co-Lending (or Co-origination) by Banks and NBFCs for lending to priority sectors.
- Co-Lending allows formal lenders (banks) and NBFCs to enter into an arrangement where risks and rewards are shared throughout the loan lifecycle based on a pre-decided ratio.
- This model helps address challenges faced by NBFCs in accessing cheaper funds and extends the reach of large commercial banks to areas where NBFCs have a stronger presence.
- NBFCs can leverage their local market presence, and banks benefit from the cheap availability of funds. It also enables banks to tap into niche customer segments and innovative credit risk assessment mechanisms used by NBFCs.
- Banks can claim priority sector status for their share of credit extended under the Co-Lending model.

## 1.15 Lead Bank Scheme
### 1.15.1 Introduction
- The Lead Bank Scheme was introduced by RBI in December 1969 with the goal of coordinating banks and developmental agencies to enhance bank finance flow to priority sectors and promote rural sector development.

### 1.15.2 Objectives

## Liquidity Trap

### Nominal and Real Interest Rate
- **Nominal Interest Rate:** Interest rate offered by banks on deposits.
- **Real Interest Rate:** Nominal rate minus inflation, represents real earning for depositors.

### Relationship with Inflation
- People prefer deposit rates higher than inflation to earn real returns on deposits.
- Example: If inflation is 6% and banks offer 8% on deposits, real interest rate is 2%.

### Stimulating the Economy
- During recession, Central Bank reduces repo rate to boost money supply and demand.
- Banks lower deposit and lending rates accordingly.
- If demand doesn't rise, Central Bank may further reduce repo rate, repeating the cycle.

### Liquidity Trap Scenario
- When repo rate reaches near-zero, banks also lower deposit rates to near-zero.
- Central Bank can't lower rates beyond zero, creating a liquidity trap.
- In a liquidity trap, people prefer keeping funds in demand deposits rather than fixed deposits due to very low interest rates.
- Investors hold onto cash, expecting future rate rise, which prolongs economic weakness.
- Central Bank's inability to lower rates below zero limits its ability to stimulate lending or spending.

### Government Intervention
- In a liquidity trap, fiscal tools like government spending become crucial to stimulate the economy.
- ==Fiscal policies can complement monetary policy limitations during a liquidity trap.==

## Inflation, Deflation, Disinflation

### Inflation
- **Definition:** Rise in general prices of goods and services, leading to reduced purchasing power.
- **Types:** 
  1. **Low Inflation:** Single-digit annual rate, encourages savings and long-term contracts.
  2. **Galloping Inflation:** Double or triple-digit rate, leads to hoarding, reduced lending, and investment.
  3. **Hyperinflation:** Over a million percent per year, causes highly unstable prices.

### Causes of Inflation
1. **Demand Pull Inflation:** Result of increased aggregate demand, often due to expanding economy or government spending.
2. **Cost Push or Supply Shock Inflation:** Triggered by rising costs of production factors or supply shortages.

### Deflation
- **Definition:** General decline in prices, caused by reduced money supply, spending, or investment.
- **Impact:** Decreases demand, leads to economic slowdown, increased unemployment, and potential depression.

### Disinflation
- **Definition:** Slowing down in the rate of inflation, where inflation remains positive but decreases over time.
- **Example:** Prices rising annually but at a decreasing rate, e.g., 10%, 9%, 4.2%.

### Relationship with Economic Recession
- In recession, demand decreases, leading to reduced production and output.
- Generally, recession leads to low inflation or deflation due to reduced demand and output.
- Exceptional cases like supply-side shocks may cause high inflation temporarily, followed by decreased demand and lower inflation.

## Phillips Curve
- **Concept:** Developed by A.W. Phillips, states an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.
- **Theory:** Lower unemployment leads to higher inflation and vice versa due to increased wages with economic growth.
- **Empirical Discrepancies:** Disproven by stagflation in the 1970s, showing high inflation and unemployment simultaneously.
- **Short-Term Implications:** Phillips curve holds true in the short term but may not be applicable in all economic situations.
